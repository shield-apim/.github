# 🛡️ Project Shield

**Project Shield** is an open-source initiative to build a modern, secure, and extensible API Gateway from the ground up.

Our mission is to provide developers and organizations with a powerful yet flexible gateway that prioritizes **observability**, **security**, and **developer experience** — without compromising on performance or openness.

This organization hosts the core components of the Shield ecosystem, including the gateway runtime, control plane, and supporting tools.

> Built for the modern API era — cloud-native, self-hosted, and community-driven.

Stay tuned. We're just getting started. 🚀
